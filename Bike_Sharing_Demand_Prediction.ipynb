Loss function is nothing but the diffence between the actual values and predicted values(aka error or residuals). There are different types of loss function but this is the simplest one. Loss function summed over all observation gives the cost functions. The role of gradient descent is to update the parameters till the cost function is minimized i.e., a global minima is reached. It uses a hyperparameter 'alpha' that gives a weightage to the cost function and decides on how big the steps to take. Alpha is called as the learning rate. It is always necesarry to keep an optimal value of alpha as high and low values of alpha might make the gradient descent overshoot or get stuck at a local minima.
